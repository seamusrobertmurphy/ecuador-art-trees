Prioritize Credits from Older Vintages: Deduct credits from 2017 and 2018 that hold lower market over time, as supported by issuance and activity data across all years.

Preserve Recent High-Value Credits: Retain credits from 2019 and 2021 for potential future transactions at higher market prices.

Document All Adjustments: Clearly outline credit deductions and provide robust justifications in the next TREES Monitoring Report (TMR) submission.

Preparation for Validation Audit: 
  
  Mitigation Measures: Verifiers will evaluate Ecuador’s actions to address reversal drivers, such as restoration initiatives, enhanced forest management, and community-based programs.

Monitoring Activities:  Ecuador’s National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) and associated QA/QC protocols will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and transparency​.

Recommendations to Address Validation Challenges:
  
  Enhance Monitoring Systems: Demonstrate advanced remote sensing and early-warning systems to detect and mitigate deforestation risks.

Document Mitigation Programs: Clearly outline community-based initiatives, restoration projects, and governance improvements to verifiers.

Strengthen Technical Preparedness: Conduct internal reviews of TREES Monitoring and Registration Documents (TMR, TRD) to identify and address inconsistencies before audits.

Scope and Objectives

This report aligns with key deliverables outlined in the contracted Terms of Reference, ensuring compliance with TREES requirements and supporting Ecuador’s long-term program sustainability. Specifically, the report focuses on:
  
  Analysis of the 2020 Emissions Reversal

Review the reversal loss calculation to confirm compliance with TREES Sections 5, 7, and 10 regarding crediting levels and emissions reductions.

Assess the impact of the reversal on future crediting periods and provide clear recommendations for credit deductions and adjustments to buffer pool contributions​.

Guidance on Buffer Pool & Credit Adjustments.

Draft strategies to address buffer pool contributions following the 2020 reversal, including reassessment of non-permanence risks as stipulated in TREES Section 7.1.3​

Provide technical advice on optimizing credit allocations for reversal compensation. 

Strategies for Mitigating Future Reversal Risks.

Review Ecuador’s National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) and MRV processes to ensure alignment with TREES requirements, including QA/QC protocols, activity data, and emission factor (EF) confidence intervals​.

Recommend enhanced remote sensing and monitoring systems for early-warning mechanisms to detect and address annual or seasonal deforestation risks.

Long-Term Sustainability and Technical Preparedness

Provide actionable guidance to improve Ecuador’s REDD+ program sustainability including scaling up community-based forest management, reforestation and restoration initiatives, integrating economic incentives for sustainable agriculture, and stronger collaboration around conservation enforcement.   

Technical Preparedness for Validation Audit

Prepare Ecuador for heightened scrutiny during validation and verification by providing technical support, capacity building, and documentation to respond to verifier findings​.
